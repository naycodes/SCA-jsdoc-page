                <p>Computers are incredibly powerful machines, capable of performing amazing feats like playing competitive chess, serving thousands of web pages, or making millions of complex calculations in less than a few seconds. But deep down, computers
                    are actually pretty dumb. Computers can only do exactly what we humans tell them to do.
                </p>
                <p>We tell computers how to behave using computer programs, which are just sets of instructions for the computers to follow. Without programs, com- puters can’t do anything at all!
                </p>
                <p>Even worse, computers can’t understand English or any other spoken language. Computer programs are written in a programming language like JavaScript.</p>
                <p>There are 3 major types of JavaScript namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-Side JavaScript (CSJS) -- an extended version of JavaScript that enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers</li>
                    <li>Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) -- an extended version of JavaScript that enables back-end access to databases, file systems, and servers</li>
                    <li>Core JavaScript -- the base JavaScript language</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Client-Side JavaScript (CSJS) and Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) are dependent on the core JavaScript and cannot work without it.</p>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

                <p>The JavaScript programming language is used to write programs that run in web pages. JavaScript can control how a web page looks or make the page respond when a viewer clicks a button or moves the mouse. Sites like Gmail, Facebook, and
                    Twitter use JavaScript to make it easier to send email, post comments, or browse web- sites.
                </p>
                <p>For example, when you’re on Twitter reading tweets and you see more tweets at the bottom of the page as you scroll down, that’s JavaScript in action.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed dynamic programming language. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement
                    interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
                <p>Why learn JavaScript?
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript isn’t the only programming language out there—in fact, there are literally hundreds of programming languages. But there are many reasons to learn JavaScript. For one, it’s a lot easier (and more fun) to learn than many other
                    programming languages. But perhaps best of all, in order to write and run JavaScript programs, all you need is a web browser like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome. Every web browser comes with a JavaScript interpreter
                    that understands how to read JavaScript programs. Once you’ve written a JavaScript program, you can send people a link to it, and they can run it in a web browser on their computer, too!

                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>and Object</li>

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and
                    the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <div class="article">
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <div class="article">
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because
                    it is available only within that function.</p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because
                    the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

            <div class="article">
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to
                    this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

            <div class="article">
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric,
                    or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL

                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
